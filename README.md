# CrimeDetectionAnalysis
The purpose of this project is to give a idea of how machine learning can be used by the law enforcement agencies to detect, predict and solve crimes at a much faster rate and thus reduces the crime rate. We will be using the technique of machine learning and data science for crime prediction of crime data set. It consists of crime information like location description, type of crime, date, time, latitude, longitude
The second major objective of crime analysis is the prevention or curtailment of crime. The information collected and processed by crime analysis essentially provides a mechanism to prevent or curtail crimes. For instance, the data of the neighborhood being involved in the majority of the crimes facilitates law enforcement agencies to concentrate on the movements of offenders living there or to create awareness among them thus enabling the curtailment of crimes to a larger extent
